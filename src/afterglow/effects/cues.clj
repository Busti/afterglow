  "Cues provide a user interface for controlling effects, by
  associating them with cells in a cue grid so they can be easily
  triggered and monitored, either through a physical grid controller,
  or the web show control interface. They also provide a way of
  binding cue variables to effect parameters, which can enable
  controller interfaces to adjust them, and of tying those variables
  to velocity and pressure sensitivity on physical grid controllers
  which have such capabilities."

(defn cue
  "Creates a cue for managing in a cue grid. `show-key` will be used
  as the effect keyword when the cue is triggered to add it to a show,
  ending any existing effect that was using that key. `effect-fn` is a
  function that will be called to obtain the effect to be started and
  monitored when this cue is triggered. It will be passed a map
  allowing lookup of any temporary variables introduced by the
  cue (see the `:variables` parameter below).

  If supplied, `:short-name` identifies a compact, user-oriented name
  to be displayed in the web interface or controller display (if it
  has one) to help identify the cue, which can be helpful if the name
  of the underlying effect is ambiguous or overly long.

 `:color` requests that the web interface and control surfaces draw
  the cue using the specified color rather than the default white to
  help the user identify it. This is only a request, as not all
  control surfaces support all (or any) colors. The color is passed
  to [[interpret-color]], so it can be specified in a variety of ways.

  `:end-keys` introduces a sequence of keywords identifying other
  effects which should be ended whenever this one is started. This
  allows a set of grid cues to be set up as mutually exclusive, even
  if they use different keywords within the show for other reasons.

  `:priority` assigns a sorting priority to the effect. If not
  assigned, a default priority of zero is used. The effect will be
  added to the show after any effects of equal or lower priority, but
  before any with higher priority. Effects are run in order, and later
  effects can override earlier ones if they are trying to affect the
  same things, so a higher priority and more recent effect wins.

  If `:held` is passed with a true value, then the cue will be active
  only as long as the corresponding pad or button on the control
  surface is held down, for controllers which support this feature.
  This can be useful for very intense cues like strobes. Show
  operators can override the `:held` flag by holding down the `Shift`
  key when triggering the cue on interfaces which have `Shift` keys,
  like the web interface and Ableton Push.

  `:variables` introduces a list of variable bindings for the cue,
  each of which is a map with the following keys:

  * `:key` identifies the variable that is being bound by the cue (for easy
    adjustment in the user interface while the cue is running). If it is
    a string rather than a keyword, it identifies a temporary variable
    which need exist only for the duration of the cue. The actual name
    will be assigned when the cue is activated. In order for `effect-fn`
    to be able to access the correct variable, it is passed a map
    whose keys are keywords made from the string `:key` values supplied
    in the `:variables` list, and whose values are the actual keyword
    of the corresponding temporary show variable created for the cue.

  * `:name`, if present, gives the name by which the variable should be
    displayed in the user interface for adjusting it. If not specified,
    the name of `:key` is used.

  * `:short-name`, if present, is a shorter version of the name which
    can be used in interfaces with limited space.

  * `:min` specifies the minimum value to which the variable can be set.
    If not supplied, zero is assumed.

  * `:max` specifies the maximum value to which the variable can be set.
    If not supplied, 100 is assumed.

  * `:start` specifies the value to assign to the variable at the
    start of the cue, if any. This is honored only for temporary
    variables introduced for the cue, in other words when `:key` is
    given with a string rather than a keyword.

  * `:type` identifies the type of the variable, to help formatting
    its display. Supported values are `:integer`, `:float`, possibly
    others in the future. If omitted or unrecognized, `:float` is
    assumed.

  * `:centered` supplied with a true value requests that the gauge
    displayed when adjusting this variable's value be like a pan
    gauge, showing deviation from a central value, for interfaces
    which support this.

  * `:resolution` specifies the smallest amount by which the variable
     will be incremented or decremented when the user adjusts it using
     a continuous encoder on a physical controller. If not specified the
     resolution is up to the controller, but 1/256 of the range from
     `:min` to `:max` is a recommended default implementation, since that
     allows access to the full DMX parameter space for channel-oriented
     values.

  * `:velocity` accompanied by a true value enables the variable to be
     set by strike pressure and adjusted by aftertouch pressure while the
     pad which launched the cue is held down on pressure-sensitive
     controllers.

  * `:velocity-min` and `:velocity-max` specify the range into
     which MIDI velocity and aftertouch values will be mapped, if they are present.
     Otherwise the standard `:min` and `:max` values will be used."

(defn function-cue
  "Creates a cue that applies the specified function to the supplied
  fixtures or heads. Automatically adds a temporary variable for
  adjusting the function value if the function is not fixed over its
  range. `show-key` will be used as the effect keyword when the cue is
  triggered to add it to a show, ending any existing effect that was
  using that key. `function` identifies the fixture function to be
  activated by this cue, and `fixtures` lists the fixtures and heads
  can which should be affected (though only fixtures and heads which
  implement the specified function will actually participate).

  Passing a value for `:effect-name` sets the name for the effect
  created by this cue. If none is provided, the name of the function
  is used.

  If supplied, `:short-name` identifies a compact, user-oriented name
  to be displayed in the web interface or controller display (if it
  has one) to help identify the cue, which can be helpful if the name
  of the underlying effect is ambiguous or overly long.

  `:color` requests that the web interface and control surfaces draw
  the cue using the specified color rather than the default white to
  help the user identify it. This is only a request, as not all
  control surfaces support all (or any) colors. The color is passed
  to [[interpret-color]], so it can be specified in a variety of ways.

  `:level` can be used to set the initial level for functions which
  have a variable effect over their range. Such functions will be
  automatically assigned a variable parameter which can be used to
  adjust the level while the cue runs, and which will be visible in
  the web interface and on controllers which support adjusting cue
  parameters. Function levels are expressed as a percentage, which is
  mapped onto the range of DMX values which are assigned to the
  function in the fixture definition. Functions with no variable
  effect will ignore `:level` and will not be assigned variables for
  adjustment.

  If `:htp` is passed a true value, the created effect applies
  highest-takes-precedence (i.e. compares the value to the previous
  assignment for the channels implementing the function, and lets the
  highest value remain). See [[channel/function-effect]] for more
  details about the underlying effect.

  `:end-keys` introduces a sequence of keywords identifying other
  effects which should be ended whenever this one is started. This
  allows a set of grid cues to be set up as mutually exclusive, even
  if they use different keywords within the show for other reasons.

  `:priority` assigns a sorting priority to the effect. If not
  assigned, a default priority of zero is used. The effect will be
  added to the show after any effects of equal or lower priority, but
  before any with higher priority. Effects are run in order, and later
  effects can override earlier ones if they are trying to affect the
  same things, so a higher priority and more recent effect wins.

  only as long as the corresponding pad or button on the control

  This can be useful for very intense cues like strobes. Show
  operators can override the `:held` flag by holding down the `Shift`
  key when triggering the cue on interfaces which have `Shift` keys,
  like the web interface and Ableton Push.

  If the function being controlled has a variable effect, and thus a
  cue variable is being introduced to adjust it, `:velocity`,
  `:velocity-min`, and `:velocity-max` will be used when creating
  that variable, allowing it to be controlled by strike and aftertouch
  pressure on control surfaces which support that feature, as described
  in [[cue]]."

  "Cause the specified cue from the [[*show*]] cue grid to be
  triggered by receipt of the specified note (when `kind` is `:note`)
  or controller-change (when `kind` is `:control`) message with a
  non-zero velocity or control value. This allows generic MIDI
  controllers, which do not have enough pads or feedback capabilities
  to act as a full grid controller like the Ableton Push, to still
  provide a physical means of triggering cues. The desired cue is
  identified by passing in its `x` and `y` coordinates within the show
  cue grid.

  Afterglow will attempt to provide feedback about the progress of the
  cue by sending note on/off or control-change values to the same
  controller when the cue starts and ends. The note velocities or
  control values used can be changed by passing in different values
  with `:feedback-on` and `:feedback-off`, and this behavior can be
  suppressed entirely by passing `false` with `:feedback-on`.

  If the controller is pressure-sensitive and you would like to have
  the velocity information passed on to any cue variables which are
  configured to respond to it, pass `true` with `use-velocity?`. Doing
  this also enables responsiveness to aftertouch messages, which can
  adjust the cue variable for as long as you are holding down the key
  or pad, if your controller sends them (and `kind` is `:note`).

  Afterglow assumes the control is momentary, meaning it sends a note
  off (or control value of 0) as soon as it is released, and a second
  press will be used to end the cue unless the cue uses the `:held`
  modifier to indicate it should be ended when the button is released.
  If your controller does not have momentary buttons and already
  requires a second press to turn off the note or control value, pass
  `false` with `:momentary?` and Afterglow will always end cues when
  it receives a control value of 0, even if cues are not marked as
  `:held`.

  Returns the cue-triggering function which can be passed
